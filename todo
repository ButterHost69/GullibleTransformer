GOAL: Create a Encoding Transformer that can predict the possibility of a News headline to be Fake or Not.

OBJECTIVES:
:: 29/10/25
- [ ] Create an Encoding Transformer using pytorch
- [ ] Write Proper Comments and Description for each class and code where needed

* Write my own
    - Tokenizer        %Started -- Will probably need to rewrite in go ... or try the new python GIL update% 
    - Positional Embedding Layer  
    - Transformer
    - Multi Headed Attention
    - Loss Function
    - Optimizer (try writing ADAMW and if time MUON)

* Can use libraries for:
    - Token Embedding Layer     %For this will simply use the nn.Embedding%
    - Backpropogation  %but will have to understand it%
